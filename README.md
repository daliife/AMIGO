# AMIGO
*An hypercasual minimal minigolf videogame*

## Description
AMIGO *(aka "a minimal golf")* is a hyper-casual minimal minigolf video game. Select a level and start playing!

## Instructions
AMIGO's mechanics and instructions are quite straightforward...

- **Click and drag** to shoot the golf ball. You will see after clicking an arrow that will indicate the force of the shot.

- **Cancel the shot** dragging your mouse/finger onto the bottom right corner of the screen

- **Action buttons**... do I really need to explain their functionality? Ok, you click/touch them and something happen.

## Challenges
Some of the challenges that I had to solve while creating this videogame are found in this list:
- Input and conversion system between screen coordinates and 3D coordinates mixed with input events (click, drag and drop).
- Persistance data between games and sessions.
- Diferentiation between scene click and button.

In the near future it would be interesting to make some improvements, like:
- Level automatization and dynamic loading.
- More level design (levels++).
- Physics and respawn tweaking.
- New gamemodes and the addition of achievements or leaderboard grids.

## Development
AMIGO's current state is still at its early prototype stages.
In the following months there is going to be some improvements regarding the number of levels and its game modes. Any kind of feedback will be very welcomed and much apreciated!
